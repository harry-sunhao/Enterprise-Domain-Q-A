This automated behavior was introduced in Java 6.1.5.0 and Java 7.0.4.0*. Compressed references (CR) decreases the size of Java objects making better use of available memory space. This better use of space results in improved JVM performance. *(Java 7.0.1.1 and later uses compressed references by default on z/OS) \n\nSee Introducing WebSphere Compressed Reference Technology [ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/webserver/appserv/was/WAS_V7_64-bit_performance.pdf] for detailed information on how Compressed References work. \n\n\"When using compressed references, the size of the field used in the Java object for the Class Pointer and the Monitor/Lock is 32 bits instead of the 64bits that would be available in non-compressed mode.

Portal can and does make heavy internal use of datasources, so miscalculating this (maximum) value can have a significant impact on system behavior. Out of the box, the default maximum setting is 50. This may or may not be sufficient for any given system. \n\nEach Portal request may make any number of database (DB) requests ranging for none to several.. Further, customized portlets and PPR (Parallel Portlet Rendering) may cause several concurrent DB requests. By default, the maximum number of WebContainer threads is also set to 50. Therefore the ratio between the maximum number of Portal datasource connections to the maximum number of Portal WebContainer threads is 1:1. Support has found that this ratio is often too low for the best performance. In the past, there have been recommendations of this ratio as high as of 2:1 or even 2.5:1. \n\nHowever, these values caused concern in large deployments where the TOTAL number of maximum datasource connections might start to place a strain on backend resources. Recent analysis suggests that these ratio values may be safely reduced to 1.25: 1 for all Portal datasource, with the exception of the jcrDB when WCM is used extensively. In this case, we recommend a ratio of 1.5:1"}

{"output": "To optimize barcode recognition: \n\n * The width of the thinnest bar (called the X-dimension) must be at least one pixel, and two pixels are recommended for best results. At 200 DPI this means each bar must be at least .01 inch. Generally this translates to about 4 to 5 characters per inch. \n * The X-dimension or width of the narrowest black bar and white space between bars must be at least 20 mils (1/50 inch, 1/2 mm). When scanned perfectly at 200 DPI this would result in 4 pixels, and at 300 DPI 6 pixels. \n * For Code 39 symbols: a 20 mil X-dimension results in a density of approximately 3.6 characters per inch. Optimally the height should be at least 1/4 inch or 15% of the width, whichever is greater, though this is not an absolute requirement. The minimum quiet zone (white space before and after the bar code) specified by the standard is 1/5 inch."}

You can add the definition to the system.cfg file to keep the setting in effect after the Netezza software restarts:\n\n\n 1. Log in to the Netezza system as the nz user account.\n    \n 2. With any text editor, open the /nz/data/config/system.cfg file. \n    \n 3. Look for a system.srcMode definition in the file to make sure that one is not already present and/or commented out. If you find an entry, make sure that system.srcMode=1 is set and not commented out with a # character. If you cannot find an entry, add system.srcMode=1 to the file. \n    \n 4. Save and close the system.cfg file.\n    \n 5. Stop and restart the NPS software using the nzstop and then the nzstart commands."}
