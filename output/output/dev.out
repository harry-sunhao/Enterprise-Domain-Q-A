Search by date/time in the Decision Warehouse tab of the Rule Execution Server console since the Decision ID and ruleset version are automatically generated with UUIDs. Match the date and time to identify the traces corresponding to your DVS tests.\n\n2. **Review Server Logs**: Review the logs for the target server for your DVS tests. The name of the target server is mentioned in the error message. This is the server that hosts the Rule Execution Server executing the DVS tests.\n\n3. **Activate Debug Information**: If no trace for your DVS tests is saved in DW and nothing relevant shows in the server logs to explain why the trace is not logged, refer to technote \"Obtaining debug information during Decision Warehouse trace capture\" to activate some trace for DW.\n\n4. **Ensure Proper Setup**: Ensure that Decision Warehouse is properly set up to log the trace for your DVS tests. Refer to technote \"Decision Warehouse query does not return any data for ruleset executions\" for troubleshooting DW issues that prevent the trace from being saved.\n\n5. **Check Memory and Trace Size**: Ensure that the target server hosting Rule Execution Server has sufficient memory to retrieve that trace. Alternatively, reduce the size of the trace, depending on what you need to retrieve when running your tests, as explained in technote \"Reducing the size of Decision Warehouse trace when running scenario suites\"."}

For\ninformation on creating OCR regions, see Creating OCR Regions.\n\n\u00b7 To get the best results from an OCR operation - place the region\nrectangle border so that the left side is close to the first character of\nthe text to be recognized. If there's a lot of space there, it doesn't\noperate as well, and sometimes the tool may fail to recognize the text. If\nyou get an OCR error, use the Zoom commands to zoom in on the area, and move\nthe left border closer to the first character. \n\n\u00b7 Fit all the borders of the region as tightly as possible around the\ntext. \n\n\u00b7 When you create an OCR region, it is automatically \"read.\" Check the\nMask/OCR List to make sure all the text appears that you want to be tested,\nand that no extra text is present. Resize or move the region if necessary.\nTo eliminate extraneous marks, you may need to make it smaller. To include\nall the text you want tested, you may need to make it larger. See Moving and\nResizing OCR Regions.\n\n\u00b7 If your region contains white or light colored text, use the Light\ntext option in the OCR Region dialog box. This box automatically opens when\nyou create an OCR region.\n\n\u00b7 If your region contains text on a gray or dark colored background,\nuse the Gray background option in the OCR Region dialog box. This box\nautomatically opens when you create an OCR region.\n\n\u00b7 If the OCR region border accidentally includes some part of a\ngraphic or icon, it may fail to recognize the text within the region. Resize\nthe region so that you don't include part of a graphic.\n\n\u00b7 Smaller fonts are harder to recognize. Larger fonts test better.\nAlso, bold fonts are easier to recognize.\n\n\u00b7 If you have a colored font on a colored background, play with the\noption settings in the OCR Region dialog box to see what works best. The\nimage is converted to black and white before sending it to be recognized.\nYou can check the OCR<number>.BMP in the Windows temp directory to see what\nwas actually produced and to use as a guide in these cases. The number in\nthis file name corresponds to the number listed in the Mask/OCR List. See\nthe note below.\n\n\u00b7 Unless you're depending on and making decisions in script based on\nthe recognized text, it's not necessarily important that all letters of a\ntext string are recognized correctly. It's only important that it be done\nthe same way during recording and playback, so that the results are\naccurate. If you notice any characters not being picked up, it may not be\nmalfunctioning, but may just have a limitation. Chances are it will work\naccurately even if every character is not recognized. \n\n\u00b7 When the OCR engine cannot recognize a character based on its\nsurroundings, it will insert a '\n~' character. Some characters in 8 point MS Sans Serif (default Windows\nfont) are harder to read than others - those with a blocky shape are easier\nthan those with angles. This is due to the DPI resolution at which they're\ncaptured versus what is provided to the recognition engine. The characters\nappear more jagged at the higher DPI if they have curves.\n\n\u00b7 We recommend 150 DPI for the best operation of OCR. This is the\ndefault setting found in the Options dialog box."}

{"output": "When should I use conversation sharing in DataPower MQ queue managers?\n\nThere are three use cases to configure Sharing Conversations in DataPower mq-qm object:\n\nCase #1: The negotiated sharing conversations value is 0 - The channel runs in a mode similar to WebSphere MQ V6 and does not use features such as Administrator stop-quiesce, Heartbeating, Read ahead, and Client asynchronous consume. Set a value of 0 or 1 on the Sharing Conversations attribute of the mq-qm object in DataPower to disable sharing conversations regardless of the IBM WebSphere MQ SVRCONN setting.\n\nCase #2: The negotiated sharing conversations value is 1 - The channel supports IBM WebSphere MQ V7 and later release features as outlined in case #1, but each TCP/IP channel instance has a single conversation. Set a value of 1 on the Sharing Conversations attribute and select \"on\" in Share Single Conversation attribute of the mq-qm object in DataPower as shown in the following picture and a value of 1 on IBM WebSphere MQ SVRCONN setting.\n\nCase #3: The negotiated sharing conversations value is 2 or more - The channel supports IBM WebSphere MQ 7 and later release features and each TCP/IP channel instance supports 2 or more conversations. Set a value of 2 or more on the Sharing Conversations attribute of the mq-qm object in DataPower and on the MQ SVRCONN channel.\n\nAre there any special values on DataPower when configuring conversation sharing?\n\nThe default setting of sharing conversations (SHARECNV) value is zero in DataPower mq-qm object. The same default value for MQ SVRCONN channel is 10. The sharing conversations value is negotiated between MQ server and DataPower and the lower value takes effect. However, in current versions of the DataPower firmware, the sharing conversations setting of 1 is treated as 0 when negotiating with MQ server."}
