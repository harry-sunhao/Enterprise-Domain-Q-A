The installer recognizes the target node as a 64bit platform and the agents are 32bit and so it does not show the expected list of agents.\n\nThe issues should be corrected at Installer level, APAR IV84919 has been opened to fix them.\n\nUntil then, you can bypass the issue with some manual steps.\n\n1) If the import of agent bundle using command tacmd addbundles fails with message:\n\nUnable to find bundle prerequisite: ci 06.22.04.000 li6263\n\nthis occurs because some agents, particularly N4 agent, have old prerequisites for shared components (ax, ui, gs,jr) that are not part of the ITM_for_VE bundle.\n\nYou must verify if the prerequisites mentioned in the error message are already present in your depot by using command tacmd viewdepot.\n\nIf all of them are already in the depot, then you can run the tamcd addbundles using flag \"-n\" (ignore prerequisites), this will allow to correctly import the agent bundle.\n\nIf you do not have the wanted prerequisite levels, you have two possible options:\n\na) retrieve and add them into depot from other ITM installation packages\nb) modify the agent dsc files and change the level of the components required by the agent to match the level delivered with the bundle.\n\n2) The above workaround can help in case the issue is only related to backleveled prerequisite packages.\n\nAnyway, once you applied it, if the target node for the N4 agent is a Linux x86-64, you will anyway not be able to install it remotely. The remote deploy of N4 agent on a Linux X86_64 fails because the installer recognizes the target node as a 64bit while the agent comes with a different architecture (li6263). The quickest workaround in this case is to install the agent locally.\n\n3) If you try to install the ITM for VE agents locally on a Linux x86_64, the usual installation procedure does not work for the same reason of point 2. The installer recognizes the target node as a 64bit platform and the agents are 32bit. So the installer menu will show no available agents to be installed.\n\nYou need to proceed as follow:\n\na) Run the local installation of N4 agent on target machine and proceed as usual when you are prompted with Installer initial questions.\nb) Select Other operating systems when you are showed this panel\n\nc) Then select Linux Intel R2.6 R3.0 (32 bit)\n\nd) At this point you will see the list of agents that can be installed on the machine.

The credential renewal check occurs on the first user login within the given time period (24 hours). For this reason, the renewal could happen at any point during a day depending on when that time period started. \n\nThe time period for automatic credential renewal has been set to 24 hours to avoid a scenario where the Content Store is hammered with queries for the users stored trusted credential every single time a user logs in. In a case where you know the users password has changed and they have reports scheduled to run within 24 hours, it's safest to manually renew the credentials within Cognos Connection. \n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nFor performance reasons, by default the trusted credentials are only automatically renewed once a day. When you change your password, you should renew your credentials manually. Otherwise, if the credentials are used before they are automatically renewed, they might not work. \n\nSteps for manually renewing credentials:\n1) In IBM Cognos Connection, click the my area options button --> 'My Preferences'.\n2) On the Personal tab, under Credentials, click 'Renew the credentials'."}

As the query is being processed the system allocates memory for each row of the result set. This includes each of the GROUP BY columns and each of the aggregates. For queries doing aggregates on variable length columns, the total length of the record will vary during the process. For example, if the current min value is \"Boston\" and the new min value is \"Albuquerque\" space for the new min value needs to increase. \n\nThe NZ_SPRINGFIELD_SIZE is an extra pseudo-column that is tacked onto each row. It does not contain any data. It is a filler that starts out at NZ_SPRINGFIELD_SIZE and then dynamically shrinks and expands as needed to keep each of the aggregate rows at a fixed length. There is a single springfield in each grouping record that has to shrink and grow to offset the combined changes in width of the running values for all min/max aggregates."}

{"output": "To serve static images from your HTTP Server instead of WebSphere 8.5 application, you can use the following steps:\n\n1) Create a subdirectory called \"static\" under the IHS DocumentRoot directory.

Something like this:\n/usr/IBM/HTTPServer/htdocs/static/\n\n2) In your web application, you will reference those files using relative references like \"static/picture.jpg\", or \"static/mystyles.css\".\n\nThose relative references will be interpreted as URLs like this:\n/myapp/static/picture.jpg\n/myapp/static/mystyles.css\n\nKeep in mind that there really is NOT any \"static\" subdirectory in the application. But that is ok.\n\n3) Now, in the IHS config, you must use RewriteCond and RewriteRule to watch for these references, and redirect to get them from IHS. For example, look at these directives...\n\n<ifModule mod_rewrite.c>\nRewriteEngine on\nRewriteRule ^/myapp/static/(.*) /static/$1 [PT]\n</ifModule>\n\nIt means, if the URI begins with /myapp/static/* then IHS will rewrite it to just /static/* and \"pass-through\". Since /static/* does NOT match anything in the Plug-in config, the request will be handled by IHS, and the file will be served from the static directory under IHS DocumentRoot.\n\nTo the user looking at the URL in the browser they will see this:\n/hostname/myapp/static/picture.jpg\n\nBut, the file will really be served by IHS from here:\n/hostname/static/picture.jpg"}

In this case, we recommend a ratio of 1.5:1.\n\nTo configure the maximum number of datasource connections for your Portal server, you should first determine the number of WebContainer threads that are running. This can be found using the WebSphere Application Server Admin Console by navigating to Servers ---> Application Servers --> WebSphere_Portal (your server) --> Thread Pools --> WebContainer.\n\nFactors to watch out for include the potential strain on backend resources and the need to scale your database accordingly.

If the RAA Eclipse plug-in for RDz was previously installed using the manual workaround (see above steps), undo that process before proceeding with plug-in installation by performing the following:\na) Close RDz\nb) Delete the RAA Eclipse plug-in .jar files (e.g. com.ibm.dmh.raai_*.jar and com.ibm.raa.integrate.doc_*.jar) from the dropins subdirectory (e.g. C:\\Program Files\\IBM\\SDP\\dropins)\nc) Start RDz\n\n2.

Use Installation Manager to perform the install.\n\nIf you are using RDz 8.5.x and 8.0.x versions, you must manually copy the RAA plug-in jar files to the Eclipse dropins folder.\n\n1.

The entries look like: <file name='file000012' alias='com.ibm.dmh.raai_6.1.0.20130918.jar'/>\n * Look for the com.ibm.dmh.raai_*.jar and com.ibm.raa.integrate.doc_*.jar aliases\n * Copy the two files (eg. file000012) to a temporary location and rename them back to the value of the alias entry (eg. com.ibm.dmh.raai_6.1.0.20130918.jar).\n\n1.2) Finding the jar files in an RAAiInstallRepository.zip file:\nLook in the plugins folder for the two files matching: * com.ibm.dmh.raai_*.jar\n * com.ibm.raa.integrate.doc_*.jar\n\n2. To find the dropins folder, look at the properties for the shortcut used to start RDz. Look at the Target property to see where eclipse.exe resides (eg. C:\\Program Files\\IBM\\SDP\"), If that folder doesn't have a dropins subdirectory, create it.\n\n3. Copy the 2 jar files to that dropins folder and then restart RDz. When starting RDz, use \"Run as administrator\" so that the plugins can be installed.\n\n4. After RDz starts, choose Window -> Preferences from the menu, and verify that you have an \"Asset Analyzer\" entry in the left pane.\n\nNOTE: RDz 8.5.x and 8.0.x versions are End-of-Service( EOS) , you should upgrade to the supported versions and take advantage of fixes and enhancements."}

If you have other instances, say WebLogic instances, make changes if you want to change the Log Level / Sampling Rate and save the files.\n\n(Note: You will always edit the instance files, never the master <hostname>_yj.xml file. Always make sure your agent has stopped and you have a backup of these instance files before editing.)\n\n6. After all files changes have been made and saved, restart the YJ J2EE agent back up again. No server restart is required.\n\n7. Login to your TEPS, you will now see the new Log Level and Sampling Rate on your panel.

An example scenario would be if you were using an External Security Manager (ESM) and Trust Association Interceptor (TAI) to handle authentication for WebSphere Portal. You could take advantage of the security invalidation and timeout features of the ESM and TAI to control when the session gets invalidated (and thus when the user gets redirected to ESM's login page to re-login)."}

{"output": "The problem occurs because by default, a JRE (Java Runtime Environment) does not allow unlimited strength encryption to be used. The exact default cryptographic strength allowed depends on the version of JRE shipped. When an HTTPS script with client certificate is executed, the playback process requires the JRE to authenticate not just the client certificate, but also its entire trust chain. So while the client certificate might be at an acceptable cryptographic strength level (eg 1024bit RSA) its parent certificate (eg root certificate is 2048 bit RSA) might not be. This can be the cause for symptom #3 listed above, as the signing authority upgrades the root certificates over time.\n\nRPT ships with its own JRE, so does the T6 agent. The RPT version doesn't necessarily match. That is why it is possible for the script to run properly within RPT Workbench but fail on a T6 agent (symptom scenario #2).\n\nTo resolve the problem, replace the following two policy files with unlimited/higher strength policy files:\n%JAVA_HOME%\\jre\\lib\\security\\local_policy.jar\n%JAVA_HOME%\\jre\\lib\\security\\US_export_policy.jar\n\nFollow the two sets of instructions below; one for the RPT's JRE, and one for the T6 agent's JRE.\n\nUpgrade policy files (link in Related URL)\n\nReplace the security files/JRE for RPT located in \nC:\\Program Files\\IBM\\SDP\\jdk\\jre\\lib\\security\nC:\\Program Files\\IBM\\SDP\\AgentController\\jdk\\jre\\lib\\security (only if you use AgentController)\n\nReplace security files/JRE for the T6 agent located in \n[ITM_HOME]\\tmaitm6\\java60\\jre\\lib\\security"}
